# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Kevin McCarthy]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [October 23, Wednesday, 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 10-23-2019
**Today's Progress**: Had an easy first day of the challenge, started freeCodeCamp's jQuery lessons as a refresher. 

**Thoughts:**: Although it was review, learned a few things jQuery functions I wasn't fully aware of (or maybe just forgot)

### R1D2 10-24-2019
**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamp's jQuery cert (no project yet) and started on their Sass cert section    

**Thoughts:**: jQuery was pretty straight forward as I've spent a lot of time on it beforehand, but sass was much more difficult.
Definitely don't fully feel comfortable with this CSS extension, but I'll finish it tomorrow and hopefully feel confident to use 
it on projects in the future.

### R1D2 10-25-2019
**Today's Progress**: Went from FreeCodeCamp's Front End Libraries to their Javascript Algorithms section. Made it almost halfway through that section because it's fairly long (110 exercises). 

**Thoughts:**: Switched to JS because I thought it was a place I needed more help on (I do), but everything was incredibly basic. Going to try and finish it tomorrow and move on to the advanced ones

### R1D2 10-26-2019
**Today's Progress**: Continued along freecodecamp's JS Algorithms. About 2/3 of the way. Got pretty distracted, but still set time 
aside to focus, which is the important thing.

**Thoughts:**: I want to start a small JS project after I'm done with this cert, but I'm not sure what to do. 

### R1D2 10-27-2019
**Today's Progress**: Took my first dive into Express while doing more JS algorithms 

**Thoughts:**: Need more Express practice

### R1D2 10-28-2019
**Today's Progress**: Followed along to the Saturday lecture I missed on Express

**Thoughts:**: Harder to follow along with when you're not in class.

### R1D2 10-29-2019
**Today's Progress**: Finished an Amazonesque app using mySQL and nodeJS for homework

**Thoughts:**: I wish I had tried for the challenge portion, but was rushing at the last minute

### R1D2 10-30-2019
**Today's Progress**: Updated Website / Portfolio with new content and changed CSS styling a bit

**Thoughts:**: Still a long way to go before I want to send this to an employer

### R1D2 10-31-2019
**Today's Progress**: Did a tutorial designing a restaurant reservation app with nodeJS and mySQL

**Thoughts:**: Didn't finish it, got stuck and will have to revisit. My server is up and running, it's on the right
port, but can't find my home/reservation/table html files even though I have the same file structure as the tutorial...

### R1D2 11-01-2019
**Today's Progress**: Updated portfolio more and started a tutorial on a Flappy Bird game, but got stuck connecting my
index html page to all the JS pages

**Thoughts:**: frustrating, but also portfolio still isn't employer ready

### R1D2 11-02-2019
**Today's Progress**: In class we introduced Handle bars for express and it was difficult to understand! Stil feel kinda lost on
express as a whole. 

**Thoughts:**: Hopefully express as  a whole will become clearer once I finish this next homework
