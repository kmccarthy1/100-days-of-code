## Log

### R1D1 10-23-2019
**Today's Progress**: Had an easy first day of the challenge, started freeCodeCamp's jQuery lessons as a refresher. 

**Thoughts:**: Although it was review, learned a few things jQuery functions I wasn't fully aware of (or maybe just forgot)

### R1D2 10-24-2019
**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamp's jQuery cert (no project yet) and started on their Sass cert section    

**Thoughts:**: jQuery was pretty straight forward as I've spent a lot of time on it beforehand, but sass was much more difficult.
Definitely don't fully feel comfortable with this CSS extension, but I'll finish it tomorrow and hopefully feel confident to use 
it on projects in the future.
